Hello, I'm **Syed Shahriyar**, a dedicated software engineer deeply immersed in the tech world.

Currently, I lead the tech team at [Turf.pk](https://turf.pk), a startup that's all about developers. It's an exciting place where we encourage innovation and coding expertise.

In addition to my work, I'm pursuing a Bachelors in Artificial Intelligence at [Dawood University](https://duet.edu.pk/), blending academic learning with practical experience to stay updated in the tech industry.

But my tech involvement doesn't stop at work. I have a passion for sharing knowledge, which I do through my YouTube channel [CodeWithShahri](https://youtube.com/@shahriyarali08?si=_arQkhUFBCCv80IT), where I help aspiring developers learn web development skills.

I also love writing. You can find my tech-focused articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@shahriyarali08), where I share my thoughts with a wider audience.

I also proudly hold the role of [MLSA](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/studentambassadors/profile/cc06833b-7bdc-41a4-8fa1-3d95cd9daffe) (Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador), actively engaging, contributing, and collaborating within the tech community.
